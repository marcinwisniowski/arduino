# Arduino Exercises

This Repository is a collection of Arduino Exercises or if you like to call it lessons.

## Hardware

### Arduino Boards

Most of the exercises are testend on:

* Arduino Leonardo
* Arduino MEGA 2560

### Additional modules

To perform the exercises it is required to use **Breadboard** and bunch of **Jumper Cables**.
Full list of additional modules can be find on [Parts List](PARTS.md). Each exercise describes
precisely what parts and modules are neede to finish the task.

## Software

This project uses Arduino sketches. All the code that address subject of exersises will followe this principle. It is assumed that [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) is installed and configured to work with Arduino compatible boards.

## Schematics

Exercises may include some schematics and visualization. Those were prepared using [Frizing](https://fritzing.org/download/).
